To investigate the effects of local genetic variation, researchers developed a new multi-parent RIL population from four wild isolates collected from two nearby sites in France, identifying nearly 9000 SNPs that improved QTL mapping and revealed significant variation in traits like lifespan and pathogen resistance. This study demonstrates that multi-parent RIL populations enhance QTL detection and provide deeper insights into local adaptation and life history trade-offs.	BMC Biology	24	17	March	2019	[heatshock]
